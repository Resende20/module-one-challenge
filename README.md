## Description

In this project a marketing agency requested to have their webpage code improved so their page follows accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines. So I refactored the existing code from their webpage with the purpose of fulfilling their request.

## Usage

When pressed any tex on the header, besides the page name, it will direct the user to the appropriate section of the page

Example:
When Online Reputation Management is pressed on the header portion of the page, it will direct you to this section of the page
